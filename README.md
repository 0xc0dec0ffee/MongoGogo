## **MongoGogo Guide**

> MongoGogo is a generic repository implementation based on ORM-like (Object-Relational Mapping) technology, aimed at helping developers effortlessly interact with databases in their applications. This package is designed to simplify database access, provide a more convenient API, and separate business logic from the details of data storage.

#### 1. Key Features

- An ORM-like implementation using [MongoDB.Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/), which simplifies database interactions.

- Easily access data.

- Inspired by EF Core, offering object-oriented database operations.

- Attribute-based management of database objects using [MongoDatabase] and [MongoCollection] attributes.

- Seamless integration with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for easy dependency injection setup.

- Support for MongoDB change stream, allowing real-time monitoring and processing of database changes.

- Bulk Operations support for efficient execution of large-scale data operations.

  

##### **Install via .NET CLI**

```csharp
dotnet add package MongoGogo 
```





#### 2. **Example**

- Few steps of `configuration` and `class building`(introduced later) to get `Collection` in abstract through the dependency resolution system.

```c#
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IGoCollection<Hospital> _hospitalCollection;

    public MyController(IGoCollection<Hospital> hospitalCollection)
    {
      this._hospitalCollection = hospitalCollection;
    }
    
    [HttpGet("GetHospitalsAsync")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Hospitals()
    {
        var hospitals = await _hospitalCollection.FindAsync(_ => true);
        return Ok(hospitals);
    }
    
    [HttpGet("GetHospitals")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Hospitals()
    {
        var hospitals = _hospitalCollection.Find(_ => true);
        return Ok(hospitals);
    }
}
```





- Additionally, MongoGogo provides abstract access to any `Collection`, `Database`, and `context`!

```c#
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IGoContext<MyMongoDBContext> _myContext;
    private readonly IGoDatabase<MyMongoDBContext.City> _cityDatabase;
    private readonly IGoCollection<Hospital> _hospitalCollection;

    public MyController(IGoContext<MyMongoDBContext> myContext,
                        IGoDatabase<MyMongoDBContext.City> cityDatabase,
                        IGoCollection<Hospital> hospitalCollection)
    {
        this._myContext = myContext;
        this._cityDatabase = cityDatabase;
        this._hospitalCollection = hospitalCollection;
    }
}
```

------

`IGoContext<T>`„ÄÅ`IGoDatabase<T>` and `IGoCollection<T>`:

- Are of generic type with very few restrictions
- Act like `IMongoClient`, `IMongoDatabase`, and `IMongoCollection<T>` from the well-known package [MongoDB.Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/).

```c#
using MongoDB.Driver;
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("GetHospitals")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Hospitals()
    {
        var hospitals = _hospitalCollection.Find(_ => true);
        return Ok(hospitals);
    }

    [HttpGet("ListCollections")]
    public IActionResult ListCollections()
    {
        var collectionNames = _cityDatabase.ListCollectionNames().ToList();
        return Ok(collectionNames);
    }

    [HttpGet("DropDatabase")]
    public IActionResult DropDatabase(string databaseName)
    {
        _myContext.DropDatabase(databaseName);
        return Ok($"{databaseName} is successfully droped.");
    }
}
```





#### 3. **Configuration**

In the `ConfigureSerivces` segment of `.net core`, pass an `IGoContext` instance into your `IServiceCollection`.

The build of concrete class `MyMongoDBContext` is introduced next part.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddMongoContext(new MyMongoDBContext("my mongodb connection string"));
    
    //...other services
}
```



------

- LifeCycleOption: `Singleton`, `Scoped`, `Transient`

In addition, you can control the lifecycle of all `IGoContext<T>`, `IGoDatabase<T>`, `IGoCollection<T>`, and `IMongoCollection<T>` using LifeCycleOption. The default is `Singleton`.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMongoContext(new MyMongoDBContext("my mongodb connection string"),
                 			 new LifeCycleOption
                             {
                                 ContextLifeCycle = LifeCycleType.Singleton,
                                 DatabaseLifeCycle = LifeCycleType.Scoped,
                                 GoCollectionLifeCycle = LifeCycleType.Transient,
                                 MongoCollectionLifeCycle = LifeCycleType.Scoped
                             });
}
```





#### 4. **Core Components: [Context], [Database], and [Collections]**

##### **[Context] And [Database]**

```xml
IGoContext<TContext>
```

- Represents a MongoDB Connection (using the MongoDB.Driver package)
- An instance stores the `connection string` and is responsible for the structure of an `entity`.
- The generic TContext, which refers to the type itself, is used for the `dependency resolution system`.

```c#
public class MyMongoDBContext : GoContext<MyMongoDBContext>
{
    [MongoDatabase]
    public class City { }

    [MongoDatabase("Log")]
    public class Logger { }

    [MongoDatabase]
    public class Admin { }
    
    public MyMongoDBContext(string connectionString) : base(connectionString)
    {
    }
}
public abstract class GoContext<TContext> : IGoContext<TContext> 
{
    //...
}
```



**Congratulations!** You have successfully set up the `database` in the `IGoContext`.

A vaild `database` of an `entity/context` must be:

- An `inner class `of `IGoContext<TContext>` which is `public` or `internal`
- Decorated with the `MongoDatabase` attribute



##### **[Collections]**

Assuming the `City` database has two collections, `City` and `Hospital`:

- Decorated with the `MongoCollection` attribute, and specify the corresponding `database` type.
- Note that this `database` type must be an `inner class` of an `IGoContext<TContext>`

```c#
// 'City' Collection
[MongoCollection(fromDatabase: typeof(MyMongoDBContext.City))]
public class City
{
    [BsonId]
    public ObjectId _id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public int Population { get; set; }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the attribute of [MongoDB.Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/) if you have some restrictions on this `collection`, `field`, or even some `Serializer`.

```c#
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;

// 'Hospital' Collection
[MongoCollection(typeof(MyMongoDBContext.City),"Hospital"]
[BsonIgnoreExtraElements]
public class Hospital
{
    [BsonId]
    public ObjectId _id { get; set; }

    [BsonElement("FullName")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [BsonIgnoreIfDefault]
    public City City { get; set; }
}
```

By default, resolution system will build exactly one `IGoCollection<TDocument>` for every `TDocument` decorated by `[MongoCollection]` .

`IGoCollection<TDocument>` is responsible for the connection between a MongoDB connection and your project.

```c#
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IGoCollection<Hospital> HospitalGoCollection;
  private readonly IMongoCollection<Hospital> HospitalMongoCollection;

    public MyClass(IGoCollection<Hospital> hospitalGoCollection,
               IMongoCollection<Hospital> hospitalMongoCollection)
    {
        this.HospitalGoCollection = hospitalGoCollection;        
        this.HospitalMongoCollection = hospitalMongoCollection;
    }
}
```

In fact, you can work with data using either `IGoCollection<Hospital>` or `IMongoCollection<Hospital>`.

The main differences between them are:

- `IGoCollection<Hospital>` is a packaged instance, but with handy methods to operate on your data.
- `IMongoCollection<Hospital>` is the instance from [MongoDB.Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/)

```c#
public async Task AddNewHospital(Hospital hospital)
{
    HospitalCollection.InsertOne(hospital);
    HospitalMongoCollection.InsertOne(hospital);
}
```

- `IGoCollection<Tdocument>` has basic method dealing your data, like `FindOneAsync`, `InsertOne`, `ReplaceOne`, `Count`, and so on.
- If you want to add extra features, you can **do it yourself** by overriding the original methods!

###### **Custom [Collection]**

If the basic functionality of `IGoCollection<TDocument>` does not meet your needs,

*(for example: printing a message and saving it as a local log)*

you can inherit `GoCollectionAbstract<TDocument>` and create your own child class.

```c#
public class MyCustomHosipitalCollection : GoCollectionAbstract<Hospital>
{
    //You dont need to worry how to deal with the  IMongoCollection instance here, the resolution system will take it.
    public HospitalRepository(IMongoCollection<Hospital> collection) : base(collection)
    {
    }
    
    //write your own code here.
    public override void InsertOne(Hospital hospital)
    {
        base.InsertOne(hospital);
        Logger.PrintAndSave(hospital); //print insert success and save
    }
}
```

After this, the resolution system will map the new child class `MyCustomHosipitalCollection` to `IGoCollection<Hospital>`.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
  private readonly IGoCollection<Hospital> HospitalGoCollection; //actually your new class HospitalRepository
    private readonly IMongoCollection<Hospital> HospitalMongoCollection; //not changed
  

    public MyClass(IGoCollection<Hospital> hospitalGoCollection,
             IMongoCollection<Hospital> hospitalMongoCollection)
    {
        this.HospitalGoCollection = hospitalGoCollection; //actually your new class HospitalRepository
        this.HospitalMongoCollection = hospitalMongoCollection; //not changed
    }
    
    public async Task AddNewHospital(Hospital hospital)
    {
        HospitalGoCollection.InsertOne(hospital);  // it will print insert success and save

        HospitalMongoCollection.InsertOne(hospital);  // nothing else
    }
}
```

- By customizing and extending the functionality provided by the package, you can tailor your solution to your specific needs while still leveraging the powerful features and ease of use provided by the package.

await _cityCollection.DeleteOneAsync(city => city.Name == "New York");
```



##### **DeleteMany/DeleteManyAsync**

```c#
_cityCollection.DeleteMany(city => city.Name == "New York");
await _cityCollection.DeleteManyAsync(city => city.Name == "New York");
```





#### 6. IGoCollectionObserver\<TDocument>

> `IGoCollectionObserver<TDocument>` implements the observer pattern for a collection of `TDocument`. It notifies subscribers when database operations such as `Insert`, `Update`, `Replace`, or `Delete` are performed on the collection.



- Here is an example code for a notification center class that receives notifications when hospital data is updated:

```c#
public class NotificationCenter
{
	public NotificationCenter(IGoCollectionObserver<Hospital> hospitalObserver)
	{
		hospitalObserver.OnUpdate(UpdateEvent);
	}
	
	private void UpdateEvent(Hospital hospital) 
	{
		//do something with hospital
	}
}
```

Do anything you want in `UpdateEvent` method.



- Unlike the other operations, the `Delete` operation returns the `_id` field. For general usage, you can use `OnDelete` method to get an `ObjectId` which was deleted from your collection

```c#
public class NotificationCenter
{
	public NotificationCenter(IGoCollectionObserver<Hospital> hospitalObserver)
	{
		hospitalObserver.OnDelete(DeleteEvent);
	}
	
	private void DeleteEvent(ObjectId _id) 
	{
		//do something with hospital
	}
}
```



- However, there are sometimes we have other type as our `_id` field. In this scenario, choose `OnDelete<TBsonIdType>` method to get your `_id` back.

```
public class NotificationCenter
{
	public NotificationCenter(IGoCollectionObserver<Hospital> hospitalObserver)
	{
		hospitalObserver.OnDelete<int>(DeleteEvent);
	}
	
	private void DeleteEvent(int _id) 
	{
		//do something with hospital
	}
}
```





#### 7. Bulk Operations (IGoBulker\<TDocument>)

> Starts from 4.0.0, bulk write is supported.

```c#
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IGoCollection<Hospital> _hospitalCollection;

    public MyController(IGoCollection<Hospital> hospitalCollection)
    {
      this._hospitalCollection = hospitalCollection;
    }
    
    [HttpPost("AddHospitalsAsync")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> AddHospitalsAsync(Hospital hospital)
    {
        var goBulker = _hospitalCollection.NewBulker();
        goBulker.InsertOne(hospital);
		goBulker.UpdateOne(hos => hos.Name == hospital.Name,
                           builder =>builder.Set(hos => hos.Population, 0));
        
	    await goBulker.SaveChangesAsync();
        
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

- Inside the method, a new `goBulker` instance is created using the `NewBulker` method of `IGoCollection`.  The `goBulker` object allows you to organize multiple database operations before saving them to the database.
- The code adds an insert operation and an update operation to the `goBulker` using the `InsertOne` and `UpdateOne` methods, respectively. The insert operation adds the `hospital` object to the collection, and the update operation sets the population of the hospital with the specified name to 0.
- Finally, the `SaveChangesAsync` method is called on the `goBulker` object to execute the pending operations and save the changes to the database.



**By using the `goBulker` object, you can group multiple database operations together and execute them in a single batch, similar to the logic used in EF Core. This can help improve performance and reduce round-trips to the database.**
